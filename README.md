This is a projected intended to build C++ functionality (of various types)
as a library that can be used in distributed and hybrid distributed-threaded
parallel computing environments.

A library functionality (with both C and Fortran bindings) has been added to
perform a certain type 3D surface data-resolution and data-dependence creation.
There are specifications on what types of elements can be used to construct
the surfaces. This functionality lacks some level of optimization and this will
be changed in the near future after careful testing is performed. If you need
more information on how to use this functionality, have a look at the example
codes and contact me.
